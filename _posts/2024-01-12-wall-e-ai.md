# **Blog Post: AI Film Analysis**

### **<ins>AI in WALL-E:</ins>** Describe the role of AI in the movie WALL-E. How are AI systems like WALL-E and AUTO depicted in the film? How do they interact with humans, and what functions do they serve in the story?

**&rarr; WALL-E**

In WALL-E, the main role of AI is to make life for humans on board of the AXIOM ship as easy going as possible really. They auotomate alot of things for them. In the film, I would say AI systems like WALL-E and AUTO depicted are depicted as the good and bad implications of what AI can develop into in the future. 

**&rarr; AUTO**


The way how AUTO interacts with the captain of the AXIOM ship is very robot-like and protective of the captain and doesn't seem to like the idea of going back to Earth likely because thats what it was programmed to do and probably also because it started to develop some sentience and just didn't want this for humans. WALL-E on the other hand is basically the opposite, trying to help EVE in doing so as well as the Captain.

### **<ins>AI Ethics:</ins>** Analyze the ethical considerations presented in the movie regarding AI and technology. Are there any ethical dilemmas or consequences of AI actions portrayed in WALL-E? How do these issues relate to real-world AI ethics?

**&rarr; Environmental Impact**


In the movie, one of the main ethical consideraitons was basically environmental degradation caused by the whole Buy 'N Large thing. The Buy 'N Large corporation is really about sustainability, which led Earth to what is waz depicted as in the movie which was really just an abandond wasteland This ethical considertaion really does relate to real-world concerns about the ethical responsibility of corporations in shaping the future for nature and the  environment.

**&rarr; Overreliance on AI**


The way how AUTO was really just being obedient and doing things mostly based off of what he was programmed to do kind of shows the dangers of relying on . The ship's occupants, being basically fully dependant on AI at this point in time, find themselves as lazy, overweight, and unable to do things without AI assistance. This warns against havign too much trust in AI systems and raises ethical questions about accountability and transparency.

### **<ins>Human-AI Interaction:</ins>** Examine the relationships between humans and AI characters in WALL-E, especially focusing on emotional connections. How does the film show the potential for human-AI bonds, and what does this suggest about the future of AI-human interactions?

**&rarr; Emotional Connections**


Throughtout the movie, WALL-E's emotions for EVE show can kind of lead on to show the potential for a world where there can be meaningful human-AI bonds. The film suggests that if AI are to one day be made with emotions, they could probably form genuine connections with humans. This kind of challenges my general and genuine notion that AI cannot be capable of experiencing and expressing real emotions that can affect themselves as well as humans.

**&rarr; Loneliness and Dependency**


On the other hand the movie portrays the downside of alot of/too much reliance on AI. The people on the Axiom, immersed in virtual realities and basically fully dependant on AI to live, experience a sense loneliness as we saw with that one guy and woman that met each other compared to the rest of the people. This really suggest to be careful about this stuff, showing the importance of maintaining a balance between convenience with technology and genuine, real human connections.

### **<ins>AI's Role in Society:</ins>** Discuss how the movie envisions the future of society concerning AI technology. What are the benefits and drawbacks of a society heavily reliant on AI, as shown in WALL-E? How does this portrayal compare to our current trajectory with AI integration in society?

**&rarr; Drawbacks**


WALL-E kind of depicts a future where AI can greatly contribute to efficiency and convenience. However, the movie definitley suggests that these benefits come at some kind of cost.


**&rarr; Benefits**


The main drawbacks of a society heavily reliant on AI like in ones in WALL-E was stuff like environment, human complacency, and the loss of individuality and people being themselves. It raises questions about the ethical responsibility of really pairing and pushing AI in society and the need for regulatory stuff to prevent bad consequences.
